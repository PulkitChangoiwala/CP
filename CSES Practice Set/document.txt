Learnings:


- Print a cycle in simple graph ::: 6_Round_Trip.cpp


- Given a n*m grid, with k post offices on the grid, and n*m-k houses on other locations, find closest post office to a house.
	::::::: Use BFS, with all post office coordinates pushed in the first iteration itself  ::: 7_Monsters.cpp



- Djikstra
	- Time Complexity: O(V + ElogV)
	- Eg Question ::: 8_Shortest_Route_1.cpp  or 11_Flight_Discount.cpp
	- Djikstra with sets is more efficient than with priority queues
	- Does not work with negative weight edges
	- Variant of Djikstra, Print k shortest path length, ::: 13_Flight_Routes.cpp


- bellaman Ford
	- TC: O(n*m)
	- Works with directed graph and undirected graphs with positive weights, as in undirected graphs with negative weights it can detect false negative cycles.
	- dis[u]!=inf && dis[v] > dis[u]+w 
		Note: We need dis[u]!=inf because we are estimating inf by taking a large value, not real infinity, thus (inf + constant) is a defined value, thus the 'if' block will run if distance of node 'u' has distance infinity. 
	- Detect negative cycle
	- Print negative cycles ::: 12_cycle_finding.cpp
	- Check If A Cycle Lies in path between two nodes ::: 10_High_Score.cpp


- Floyad Warshaall
	- TC: O(n^3)
	- Eg Question ::: 9_Shortest_Route_2.cpp
