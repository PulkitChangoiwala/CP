from c:
To accomodate base cases around indices 0 and n-1 we theoretically expands the array on both sides, constraining it to the given conditions.
This helps us to solve base cases in similar way as general cases.


from e:

1)
for making an array of 'n' number k-cyclic we need to place same elements at gcd(n,k) apart.
Thus we need e = n/gcd(n,k) elements of the same type. And let there be such 'g' groups then 
if g*e >=n (i.e. total number of elements which can be divided in group of 'e' same  elements) 
then array can be k-cyclic.

2) STL function for gcd is __gcd(a,b)


from f1:

--> When sorting and asking number of swaps then we can look for LIS of given array which is sorted.
--> Here instead of actual value only ordering matters so we reduce the array A to A' with values from 
0 to n-1. Keeping the ordering.
